- All x86 CPUs have four general purpose registers:
    * ax, bx, cx, dx: max size = 2 bytes

- BIOS loads boot sector to address: 0x7c00

- The stack is implemented by registers: bp and sp (address to stack bottom and top)

- The following jump instructions are available base on: cmp x, y
    * je   target   ; jump if equal                    (i.e. x == y)
    * jne  target   ; jump if not  equal               (i.e. x != y)
    * jl   target   ; jump if less  than               (i.e. x < y)
    * jle  target   ; jump if less  than or  equal     (i.e. x  <= y)
    * jg   target   ; jump if  greater  than           (i.e. x > y)
    * jge  target   ; jump if  greater  than or  equal (i.e. x  >= y)

- Functions in x86 Assembly:
    * pusha and popa so the function doesn't destroy
      any values stored in the general purpose registers.

    * Definition:
        some_function:
            pusha   ; push all register values to the stack
            ...     ; function body
            popa    ; restore register values
            ret

    * Invocation:
        call some_function
